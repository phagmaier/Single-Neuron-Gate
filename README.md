# Single-Neuron-Gate
Creates any type of single gate (can't do XOR can also be slightly tweaked to perform other simple operations)
Was inspired by tsoding to try and make my own vectorized python version of a simple neural network that is really just a neuron



## IMPROVMENTS TO MAK
Back function is not very efficient and for some reason the non vectorized version of this code out performs this version so I need to figure out why that is and possibly make it both more effieicnt and have the answers converge like they do in the non vectorized version.
